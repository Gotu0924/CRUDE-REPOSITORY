This Laravel API allows authenticated users to manage tasks through Postman. To retrieve tasks, send a GET request to /api/tasks which returns only tasks belonging to the logged-in user. To create a task, send a POST request to /api/tasks with JSON fields title, description, and author, which are validated by TaskRequest and stored in the database. To get a specific task, send GET /api/tasks/{id}, which returns the task only if the user_id matches the authenticated user. Updating a task is done through PUT /api/tasks with JSON containing id and the new title, and deleting a task is performed using DELETE /api/tasks with JSON containing only the id. Each response uses your custom HttpResponses trait to return success or error messages in a consistent JSON format.
