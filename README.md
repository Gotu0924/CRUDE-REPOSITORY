This repository contains a simple Laravel REST API that you can fully test using Postman. After cloning the project, install dependencies using `composer install`, copy the `.env` file, configure your MySQL database credentials, generate the app key, and run migrations. Start the server with `php artisan serve` to access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can test all endpoints in Postman, including: **GET** `/api/tasks` to list tasks, **POST** `/api/tasks` with JSON (`title`, `description`) to create tasks, **GET** `/api/tasks/{id}` to view a task, **PUT** `/api/tasks/{id}` to update a task, and **DELETE** `/api/tasks/{id}` to remove a task. This single paragraph gives you everything needed to install the project and test the API directly in Postman.
